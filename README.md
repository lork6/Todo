## Know issues

1. If you fast grab a card and place it to another column, then the card is can't be grabbed again until a another card is grabbed.
   
   This is beacuse the change is made in while grabbing (onDragUpdate) the card. onDragUpdate function is sending the new [Todo item](#todo-item) to the server.  if you do it fast the [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) will not update properly.
   
   One solution is doing it in onDragEnd, but then the card is flickering for a second between two position.
